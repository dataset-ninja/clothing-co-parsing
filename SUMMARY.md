**CCP: Clothing Co-Parsing Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the retail industry. 

The dataset consists of 2098 images with 8273 labeled objects belonging to 59 different classes including *null*, *skin*, *hair*, and other: *shoes*, *bag*, *pants*, *sunglasses*, *dress*, *purse*, *coat*, *accessories*, *blouse*, *belt*, *shirt*, *skirt*, *jeans*, *sweater*, *hat*, *t-shirt*, *blazer*, *stockings*, *suit*, *bracelet*, *scarf*, *jacket*, *sandals*, *socks*, *shorts*, and 31 more.

Images in the CCP dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 1094 (52% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, the non-labeled images contain clothing tags. The dataset was released in 2014 by the Sun Yat-sen University, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and SYSU-CMU Shunde International Joint Research Institute.
